# Enhancements

To ensure that I keep the task within its scope I did the implementation with JSON files to store data, but I did reduce the amount of transmitted data between
front-end and back-end applications because we have to take scalability in mind always.

- Make the project based on the database.
- Use a more efficient search method for a more scalable solution.
- Add authentication service.
- Use E2E and integration tests.
